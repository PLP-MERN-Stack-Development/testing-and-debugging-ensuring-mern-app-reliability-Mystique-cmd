The project focuses on implementing comprehensive testing strategies for a Mern Stack application, including unit testing, integration testing, and end to end testing along with debugging techniques.

## Project Overview

1. Testing environments for both client and server
2. Unit tests for React components and server functions
3. Integration tests for API end-points
4. End to end tests for critical user flows
5. Debugging techniquse for common MERN stack issues
